        <div class="aboutText"><p class="aboutTextP">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy passion for coding began in 1999. I was a freshman at North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina. I remember my first web page design was very "monochromish" looking. We didn't have all the styling options that we have today. My most memorable project was written in Java where I built a pretty simple mortgage calculator on my own. That in itself isn't a huge feat, but considering we didn't have YouTube videos to reference at the time, it was quite the accomplishment. <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSadly, life's obstacles hit me hard and I ended up dropping out of school in order to take care of my family. Over the years I have attempted several times to go back and complete my education so that I could pursue what was once my passion. Here I am approaching the end of that journey after 23 years. It has been long hard road which has seen me through many career fields. I've worked labor jobs in construction, electrical and plumbing; worked in warehouses driving forklifts and handling shipping and receiving; worked for several years in the pawn business; been the low guy on the roster to manager positions throughout the food industry; and most recently done computer and electronic repairs.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow it's time for me to turn my path back to what I love. Writing lines of code has always been where my heart has been. I built my first computer from scrap parts that my high school district was throwing in the dumpster. The faculty was amazed I even knew how to do it. They wouldn't let me keep it though since it was "school" property, but they did allow me to set it up in one of our classrooms for everyone to use. I began programming with Java and Visual Basic in the 11th grade. I remember my mom thinking that I was crazy typing stuff that didn't make sentences at all. The concept of coding was alien to her, but she encouraged me to continue. Even now, in my 40s, I find comfort sitting behind a keyboard and putting together simple websites and apps. I hope in the future to be part of a company that will do something meaningful for the human race.</p></div>
