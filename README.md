# **Who_is_James**
<br>

## **Description**
A never ending portfolio page of some of my work that will constantly be updated as I complete future projects. With convenient links you can access my email and check me out on various social media platforms. I want to make it easy for a recruiter or potential employer to be able to do research on me. This also gives me a chance to showcase my skills to these individuals.
